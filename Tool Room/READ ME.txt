About Tool Room Scheduling System...

This project is a compiled project for my OS class defence. Made this in 2weeks (Some codes from previous projects).
Hope you will learn something with this system. This system has a lot of features aside from Scheduling processes.
It's not yet complete for now, specially on reports.. I made some report categories and some are on progress. 

Please do NOT sell or use this system on your credits. :-)

Before you open the .vbp file, Execute the "Run me first.bat"
If you like to program, please vote.. Thanks
